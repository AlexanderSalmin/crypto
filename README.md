# crypto

Simple program to demonstrate how openssl can encrypt messages
with a public key and decrypt the same message with a private key.
Purpose of this excercise is to show a simple example where no
mathematical or advanced engineering is needed to achive simple
encryption. Remember, crypto is fun!

# Setup

Start by running setup.sh, this will generate the keys. 

## Encryption
Once the keys have been generated, run encrypt.sh as this will demonstrate the message encryption and generate a message.enc

## Inspect / Review

Inspect message.enc, cat it, file it, vim it, emacs or nano the file. Loads of garbage data.

## Decrypt

Run decrypt.sh, and retrieve the hidden message.
